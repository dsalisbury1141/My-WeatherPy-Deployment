My adventure began in July 2020 with the objective was to observe weather conditions across the globe. 
This assignment was to select cities across the world with varying distance from the equator. 
To accomplish this, I used simple Python library and an OpenWeatherMap API, along with and a little ingenuity to create a representative model of weather across world cities. 
My Assignement was to randomly select a minimum of 500 unique cities accross the globe, based on latitude and longitude. I performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls included a log print of each city as it was being processed with the city number and city name. Then saved the weather data to a csv, I began to use Pandas data modeling to create specific data frames to identify my specific preferred temperature then create several plots to document for each condition listed below. For each one of these specific conditions go to the plots page to review the outcome

     
<li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>

This assigment was fun if I had more time I would have sproosed it up more but larger homework and projects on the near horizon.
